        Commit Porto is a tech conference that brings together professionals who tackle challenges
        in software development with the latest technologies. Now in its sixth edition the
        conference is only possible due to the generous support of our sponsors.

        Together we are able to invite a high quality panel of speakers from different backgrounds
        that have in common a love for technology and for sharing their knowledge with our
        participants.
