Static code analysis has sought to reduce this problem over the last 20+ years and has been evolving to allow teams to automate and standardize quality across teams at scale. This talk takes a look at how SCA has evolved and where it is likely headed in the future.</p>",

In April 2018, her project React Kawaii won the \"Fun Project of the Year\" award at React Amsterdam! Music was also a big part of her life. She was the first female solo Hip-Hop artist signing to a major label (Universal Music) in Portugal. Her songs reached the top of MTV Portugal's charts, but she soon realized that she was not meant to be an artist. She found out that she is much happier designing, coding, and speaking at conferences all around the world!",

Although CI/CD platforms offer many benefits, in the attempt to make sophisticated pipelines, many teams run into the issue of “Pipeline Sprawl”. Pipeline sprawl makes it difficult for DevOps teams to identify and reuse common execution patterns which diminishes their ability to efficiently ship new code. <br><br> In this talk, Angel will discuss the common pain points associated with existing CI/CD platforms. The talk will pull in examples from his recent experience and conversations with DevOps teams from across the open source community, startups, and large enterprises. Attendees will learn technical strategies to develop pipeline configurations that diminish potentially costly vendor-lock in.</p>",
